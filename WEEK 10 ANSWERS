Q1) Consider the following algorithm for factoring an integer N provided as input in binary): For i = 2 to (i, N/i). Which of the following statements is true?

 This algorithm is not correct, because it will sometimes fail to find a factorization of N even if N is composite.
 This algorithm is not correct, because it will sometimes output a non-trivial factorization of N even when N is prime.
 This algorithm runs in sub-linear time, and always factors N if N is composite.
 This algorithm is correct, but it runs in exponential time.




Q2) Which of the following is NOT a group?

 The set {0, 1, 2,..., 27} under addition modulo 28.
 The set {1,3,7,9} under multiplication modulo 10.
 The integers under multiplication.
